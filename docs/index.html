    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <p>
        We are making a program that can automatically operate the artillery in the video game "Hell let Loose".  
        The program should recognize a marker, which can be set manually on the map. 
        With the position of the artillery gun and the marker, the gun will then align itself to fire into the area of the marker. 
        If we still find time, we will rewrite the program so that it can automatically detect the screen size and adjust the calculations to it. 
        For now, we'll code it with the standard of 1080P.

    <h2>Information</h2>

    <p>
        The Program is only working at a resolution from 1920x1080 and when you are not the Commander. 
        It is not Recomended to play as Officer because the Detection of the marker wont find the differece between the markers.
        Also it expects the game to be on the screen that is set in windows as the primary screen.
        There may be issues if your Device is not up to spec.
    </p>

    <h2>Manual</h2>  

    <p>
        Once you are at the artillery you just need to Press the "Start" button and Tab back in the game. 
        The Program is going to Open the map and wait for a Marker to Pop up. 
        Once it found a Marker it is going to automatically Calculate the best settings and align the artillery Canon.
        Then the artillery will fire three shots, after that it will start searching markers again.        
    </p>

    <h2>Settings</h2> 

    <p><u>artillery position</u>: Here you need to select on which side of the map your artillery is positioned.</p>
    <p><u>artillery type</u>: Select on which team you are</p>
    <p><u>angle north</u>: The difference from the north of the map and the real north in degrees</p>
    <p><u>artellery coordinates</u>: the position of the artillery in which you currently are</p>
    <p><u>save settings</u>: if you press this button the Settings will still be the way you saved them the next time you open the programm</p>
